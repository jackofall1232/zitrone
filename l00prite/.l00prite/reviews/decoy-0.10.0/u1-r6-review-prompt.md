# ADVERSARIAL REVIEW — Zitrone 0.10.0-beta, Unit U1 — **ROUND 6: FINAL CONFIRM ROUND (HARD CAP)**

Two independent, blind reviewers. You do not see the other's findings.

## Why this round exists, and what it is NOT

**Round 5 reached convergence on code: both blind reviewers independently returned 0 P1 and 0 P2.**
All three round-5 findings were documentation. Those have now been corrected by the architect.

**This is the hard cap — round 6 of 6. No further rounds will be run regardless of what you find.**
The unit then goes to a human maintainer for a merge decision.

This round is NOT a re-litigation of the code. It is a confirm round with one specific focus, plus a
final whole-unit pass.

## The specific focus: the architect's own doc corrections are UNREVIEWED, and their track record is bad

The user-facing storage-format disclosure in `docs/design/DECOY_TRAFFIC_0.10.0_SPEC.md` §4.1 has now
been rewritten **four times**. Every previous version was found wrong by a later review round, in a
different direction each time:

1. Originally too broad — "vaults created by 0.10.0 cannot be opened by 0.9.x".
2. Then understating — "the first time it sends any", when registration alone installs the tag.
3. Then **overstating — the architect's own proposal**, "tries to send", when a pre-`register`
   failure retires the deferral and keeps 0.9.x readability.
4. Then false under crash-at-any-instruction — a crash between the write-ahead flush and `register`
   leaves the tag with the relay never contacted.

**The architect has been wrong on this specific sentence three times out of three.** The fifth
version deliberately abandons stating a precise boundary and instead tells the reader how to resolve
their own uncertainty. Read it against what the code actually does and decide whether it is true.
**Derive your judgment from the source, not from the sentence's own explanation of itself** — that is
the exact error that produced versions 2, 3 and 4.

Also confirm the corrections made alongside it:
- the crash row added to the `TAG_DECOY` truth table (spec §4.1 and the invariant table);
- invariant table **W2** corrected to `storeTokensForAccount` and the field table's token writers
  gaining **W2c**;
- the counter-invariant **summary block**, which until round 5 still taught "`mutate` = durable" —
  round 1's headline P1, verbatim, four rounds after it was fixed everywhere it was cited.

Is any restatement of that misconception still present anywhere else — in kdoc, comments, the spec,
or this table? That was round 5's lesson and it is the most likely thing to still be wrong.

## Then: a final whole-unit pass

Review the **whole unit**, not the delta. If it is clean, **say so plainly** — `VERDICT: CLEAN` is
the expected and useful outcome here, and padding with manufactured P3s at the cap actively harms the
maintainer's decision. If something real remains, this is the last chance to say it.

## Project

Zitrone is a production Signal-Protocol E2E messenger whose headline guarantee is a
**plausible-deniability second vault**: two independent vaults (slot A / slot B) behind one
ordinary PIN/passphrase unlock screen, plus a "Pucker Burn" duress credential. The adversary to
assume throughout:

- **Physical device + forensics + many forced/observed unlocks.** May compare an A-session against a
  B-session looking for ANY distinguisher — on disk, in timing, in prompts, in logs, in file sizes.
- **A hostile relay operator** who sees every message envelope's cleartext fields.
- **A passive network observer** who sees TLS frame sizes and timings only.
- Assume **crash, process death, or rotation at ANY instruction**.

The vault's durable state is one sealed, **fixed-size** AEAD region per slot. Its plaintext is a
single `VaultState` encoded as TLV-over-DEFLATE. If anything about the encrypted image varies with
what a vault *contains*, deniability is broken.

## What U1 is

0.10.0-beta adds **decoy (cover) traffic**. Each vault gets its own **synthetic relay account** that
decoys are addressed to, so no real contact needs decoy-recognition logic. U1 is the first unit: it
provisions that synthetic account and stores its credentials in a **new `TAG_DECOY = 0x06` section**
of `VaultState`. **U1 is deliberately UNWIRED** — nothing constructs it yet; sending is U2/U3.

**Branch: `feat/0.10.0-decoy-u1-provisioning` (checked out). Base: `a4f118df` on main.**
See the whole unit with: `git diff a4f118df..HEAD -- apps/`

## SCOPE — read this carefully

**Review the WHOLE UNIT, not a delta.** A previous release shipped a real security defect precisely
because reviewers scoped themselves to a fix diff and never re-read the original unit. Every line of
these files is in scope, including code that was not the "point" of the change:

- `apps/android/app/src/main/java/com/zitrone/app/crypto/vault/VaultState.kt` (the codec — `TAG_DECOY`, `DecoyState`, encode/decode/wipe)
- `apps/android/app/src/main/java/com/zitrone/app/data/DecoyAuthStore.kt`
- `apps/android/app/src/main/java/com/zitrone/app/decoy/DecoyIdentity.kt`
- `apps/android/app/src/main/java/com/zitrone/app/decoy/DecoyRelayApi.kt`
- `apps/android/app/src/main/java/com/zitrone/app/decoy/DecoyAccountProvisioner.kt`
- `apps/android/app/src/main/java/com/zitrone/app/decoy/DecoyCounterReservation.kt`
- All five test files under `apps/android/app/src/test/java/com/zitrone/app/` added by this unit.

**Also in scope: the tests themselves.** A test that passes while asserting nothing is a defect. Ask
of each: *would this test still pass if the behaviour it claims to pin were broken?*

## Required reading before you judge

1. `docs/design/DECOY_TRAFFIC_0.10.0_SPEC.md` — the approved spec. §2.3 (counter reservation),
   §4 (the WRITER/READER invariant table), §4.2 (account deletion), §6.2a (registration budget).
2. `l00prite/.l00prite/reviews/decoy-0.10.0/u1-invariant-table.md` — the WRITER/READER table built
   before the code. **Attack this too.** If a row is wrong, or a writer/reader is missing from it,
   that is a finding.
3. `docs/VAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md` §3–§8 for the deniability model.

## The invariants to attack

Do not treat this as a checklist to confirm. Treat each as a claim to falsify.

1. **Register-before-commit ordering.** The synthetic account must be registered on the relay
   *before* its credentials are committed to `VaultState`. A crash or failure anywhere must leave an
   **orphaned relay account** (inert, acceptable) and never a `VaultState` referencing an account
   that does not exist, and never a persisted account id with no usable signing key. Enumerate every
   crash point and say what state each leaves.
2. **Counter reservation: skip, never regress.** `message_number` values are reserved 64 ahead and
   spent from RAM. A crash may skip values; it may **never** reuse or regress one, because a real
   Double Ratchet never does and a regression is a fingerprint. Can you construct a sequence — crash,
   concurrent mutate, session close, re-unlock, reservation exhaustion at a boundary — that reissues
   or regresses a counter?
3. **Key material.** The section holds a **raw private key**. Every path must *zero* it, not merely
   drop the reference — including on decode failure, on encode failure, on capacity overflow, on
   OOM, and on close. Is there any path where key bytes survive in the heap, or where a buffer is
   grown/copied leaving an un-zeroable original?
4. **Deniability — the highest-severity class.** Nothing about decoy state may be observable outside
   the sealed region. No device-level storage (`SharedPreferences`, `SettingsRepository`,
   `DeviceSettings`), no logging, no diagnostics, no slot/vault-index naming, no timing or size
   difference between a vault that has decoy state and one that does not. **Does the encrypted image
   change size or shape based on decoy content?** Does anything let an adversary count vaults or
   distinguish A from B?
5. **Strict-v1 codec correctness.** An unknown tag throws by design (never skipped). The section is
   *omitted entirely* when empty, so that a vault which never generates cover traffic stays readable
   by 0.9.x. Is `isEmpty` correct for every partially-populated state? Can a section be written that
   round-trips to something different, or that a decoder accepts as valid but means something else?
   Duplicate tags, truncation, length overruns, integer overflow in bounds checks, trailing bytes.
6. **Capacity.** Encoding must not exceed `MAX_PAYLOAD_CONTENT_BYTES`. Overflow sets
   `capacityExceeded`, which fail-closes `flushBeforeAck` — so an overflow is a **durability** bug,
   not a cosmetic one. Is the measured budget (claimed 640–643 B worst case against a 1024 B budget)
   actually worst-case? What input maximizes it?
7. **Mutation discipline and locking.** All durable writes go through `VaultRuntime.mutate`. Lock
   order is `runtime.stateLock → session locks → storage lock`, and a runtime method must never be
   called from inside a persist sink. Any reentrancy, any lock inversion, any escaping reference to
   a live-state array handed out beyond the lock (a use-after-wipe class that has bitten this
   codebase before)?
8. **Presence ≠ readiness.** A durable 429 back-off field means the section can exist while holding
   no credentials. Every reader must key on the credential pair, never on section presence. Find any
   reader that gets this wrong.
9. **Registration is a scarce shared global resource.** `registerLimit` is 300/hour keyed on a
   single global bucket. Provisioning must be lazy, must back off across sessions on 429, and must
   degrade **silently** to decoys-off — never blocking onboarding, never surfacing an error implying
   a fault. Can it hot-loop, retry tightly, or spend more than one registration per vault?

## Output format

For each finding:

- **Severity**: P1 (data loss / key leak / deniability break / unauthorized destroy) · P2 (real
  defect, bounded blast radius) · P3 (correctness nit, doc/test gap)
- **File:line**
- **The concrete failure**: exact inputs, interleaving, or crash point → the wrong outcome. Not "this
  could be racy" — show the sequence.
- **Why the existing tests do not catch it.**

End with an explicit verdict line: `VERDICT: CLEAN` or `VERDICT: FINDINGS (n P1, n P2, n P3)`.

**Resolve every claim against the source in this tree.** Do not report what the code probably does.
If you cannot verify something, say so rather than asserting it. A confident wrong finding costs
more than a missed one, because it burns a fix round.
