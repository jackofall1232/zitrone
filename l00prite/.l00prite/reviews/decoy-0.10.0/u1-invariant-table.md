# U1 (decoy traffic — synthetic-account provisioning + `TAG_DECOY`) — WRITER/READER invariant table

Built BEFORE implementation, per the standing rule: any change to a durable multi-reader signal gets
its writers, its readers, and **what each reader assumes the signal MEANS at the moment it reads**
enumerated first. The durable signal here is **`VaultState` TLV section `TAG_DECOY = 0x06`**.

Source-verified against `main` @ `d44616c5`:
`crypto/vault/VaultState.kt` (tags `0x01`–`0x05` at 158–162; strict-v1 unknown-tag throw at 286 under
the comment at 285; `VaultState.wipe()` at 83–92; `parsePlaintext` decode-failure wipe at 311–320),
`crypto/vault/VaultRuntime.kt` (single mutation gate, 119–144; `capacityExceeded` 96–98;
`flushBeforeAck` 168–186), `ZitroneApp.kt` (`SessionContainer` 1562+, decode-at-construction 1600+),
`data/AuthStore.kt` (`AuthState` 27–31, `VaultAuthStore` 134–161),
`net/ApiClient.kt` (`register` 147–169, `createSession` 176–187, `refreshSession` 193–198),
`server/internal/auth/jwt.go:26` (`RefreshTokenTTL = 7 * 24 * time.Hour`),
`server/internal/api/handlers.go:54,166`, `server/internal/db/schema.sql:34-40`.

**Two spec facts were re-verified and found STALE — see “Spec corrections” at the end.** Neither
changes the design; both change what U1 may assume.

## The signal

A new **optional** TLV section in the per-vault sealed payload. It holds, for the vault it lives in:

| Field | Type | Purpose | Written by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `accountId` | nullable utf8 | the synthetic relay account's UUID | W1 |
| `identityKeyPair` | nullable bytes | libsignal `IdentityKeyPair.serialize()` — the synthetic account's long-term identity (PRIVATE key material) | W1 |
| `accessToken` / `refreshToken` | nullable utf8 | that account's session tokens | W1, W2 |
| `counterHighWater` | i64 | counter-reservation high-water mark: every value `< counterHighWater` is considered ISSUED | W3 |
| `deadAirNextFireAtMs` | nullable i64 | dead-air schedule next-fire (field reserved; **U1 never sets it**) | W4 (U5) |
| `provisionNotBeforeMs` | nullable i64 | cross-session provisioning deferral after a 429 (**added by U1 — see “Deviations”**) | W1b |

It lives inside the vault region and nowhere else. **Nothing decoy-related may be written to
device-level storage** (`SettingsRepository`, `DeviceSettings`, any `SharedPreferences`) — a
device-level record of how many synthetic accounts exist is a vault-count oracle and destroys the
deniability `VAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md` §3 establishes. **This extends to diagnostics:**
`BootDiagnostics` writes a device-level file, so no decoy component may take a diagnostics or log
sink at all. That is enforced structurally (the U1 classes have no such constructor parameter), not
by discipline.

The sealed region is fixed-size (`SLOT_PAYLOAD_BYTES = 256 KiB`, `VaultPayload.kt:17`) and does not
grow, so the section's presence or absence is not observable from the encrypted image.

## WRITERS

| # | Writer | When | What it writes into `TAG_DECOY` | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | `DecoyAccountProvisioner.provision()` | first unlocked session in which provisioning is requested, no synthetic account exists, and no deferral is in force | **ONE `mutate`** setting `accountId` + `identityKeyPair` + both tokens together. Never a partial credential set. | **this unit (U1)** |
| W1b | `DecoyAccountProvisioner.provision()` on **429** | relay answers `register` with 429 `rate_limited` | `provisionNotBeforeMs` only; credentials untouched (still absent) | **this unit (U1)** — see Deviations |
| W2 | `DecoyAccountProvisioner` token paths (`mintSession()` / `refreshTokens()`, via `DecoyAuthStore`) | session mint at unlock; refresh on a mid-session 401 (refresh-token TTL is 7 days, `auth/jwt.go:26`) | tokens only; all other fields untouched | **this unit (U1)** |
| W3 | `DecoyCounterReservation.next()` | reservation exhausted (once per 64 issued counters) | `counterHighWater` only, **monotonically increasing** | **this unit (U1)** — moved from U2 by the U1 task brief |
| W4 | `DeadAirPinger.rearm()` | after each dead-air ping fires | `deadAirNextFireAtMs` only | **U5 — not built here** |
| W5 | `VaultRuntime.mutate` (existing) | every write above, without exception | re-encodes the WHOLE `VaultState` under `stateLock` and schedules one atomic reseal | existing |

**W5 is not a formality.** There is no decoy-specific persistence path: `DecoyAuthStore` and
`DecoyCounterReservation` reach disk only through `VaultRuntime.mutate`, exactly as `VaultAuthStore`
does. Lock order stays `reservation lock → runtime.stateLock → session locks → storage lock`
(the reservation lock is a new OUTERMOST lock held by exactly one class; nothing takes
`runtime.stateLock` and then the reservation lock, and no decoy component is ever called from inside
a session persist sink).

## READERS, and what each assumes `TAG_DECOY` MEANS

| # | Reader | Assumes `TAG_DECOY` means | Still true after W1–W4? |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | `VaultStateCodec.decode` | "a section tag I recognize; an unrecognized tag is corruption" (`VaultState.kt:285-286`) | **NO for 0.9.x builds — see the hazard below.** YES for builds carrying the tag. |
| R2 | `DecoyCounterReservation` / `DecoySender.send()` (U2) | "these counter values have never been issued before" | YES — the reservation is written durably BEFORE any value in it is spent, so a crash SKIPS values and can never reuse one. |
| R3 | `DeadAirPinger` (U5) | "next-fire is in this vault's own timeline, not the device's" | YES — per-vault, torn down at lock. **U1 leaves the field unset**, so U5 inherits `null` = "never armed". |
| R4 | provisioning entry point (`DecoyAccountProvisioner.provisionIfNeeded`) | ~~"absent section = not provisioned; present = ready"~~ **CORRECTED:** "`accountId != null && identityKeyPair != null` = ready; anything else = not provisioned" | YES **only with the correction**. The original row is falsified by W1b: a 429 creates a section that is PRESENT and NOT ready. Readiness must be derived from the credential pair, never from section presence. |
| R5 | `VaultRuntime.capacityExceeded` (via `mutate` → `encode`) | "the encoded state fits `MAX_PAYLOAD_CONTENT_BYTES`" | YES, **and it is proved, not assumed** — U1 ships a measured worst-case byte budget (`DECOY_SECTION_BUDGET_BYTES`) and a test asserting it. `capacityExceeded` fail-closes `flushBeforeAck` (`VaultRuntime.kt:176-178`), so an overflow here is a durability bug, not cosmetic. |
| R6 | `VaultState.wipe()` (`VaultState.kt:83`) | "every held secret is zeroed / dereferenced at close" | **NO until amended — this is a NEW obligation.** `identityKeyPair` is raw private key material in a `ByteArray`, the exact class of secret `wipe()` is required to ZERO (not merely dereference). U1 amends `wipe()`. |
| R7 | `VaultStateCodec.parsePlaintext`'s decode-failure catch (`VaultState.kt:311-320`) | "a decode failure strands no key material un-wiped" | **NO until amended.** The catch today zeroes only the partial `signal` map. `TAG_DECOY` decodes to a live private key that a LATER malformed/duplicate/unknown section would strand. U1 extends the catch. |
| R8 | `SessionContainer` init (`ZitroneApp.kt:~1600`) | "`VaultStateCodec.decode` throws ⇒ refuse the unlock, wipe the `VaultOpen`" | YES, unchanged — and this is the path a 0.9.x downgrade takes (see hazard). |

## THE HAZARD THIS TABLE EXISTS TO CATCH

**`VaultStateCodec` is strict-v1: an unknown tag THROWS, it is never skipped** (`VaultState.kt:286`,
comment at 285: "an unknown tag is corruption / a wrong version, never skipped"). A vault written by
a 0.10.0 build carrying `TAG_DECOY`, then opened by a 0.9.x build — downgrade, sideload of an older
APK, a rollback — **does not degrade gracefully: it reads as a corrupt vault.** `SessionContainer`'s
decode-first construction (R8) turns that into a refused unlock.

**RULING (maintainer, 2026-07-27, spec §4): option (a).** One-way format bump, disclosed exactly as
0.9.1's fresh-install-only decision was. **Do NOT add forward-tolerance to the codec.** U6 owns the
disclosure text (spec §4.1); U1 must not weaken the strictness to soften it.

**Second-order consequence U1 must respect:** the break is only *realized* when a vault actually
carries the tag. U1 therefore writes `TAG_DECOY` only when it has something real to record —
credentials, a reservation, or a deferral — and omits the section entirely otherwise. A vault that
never provisions and never gets a 429 stays byte-compatible with 0.9.x by construction. This is a
consequence of "optional section, omitted when unset", not a new tolerance mechanism.

## THE ORDERING CONSTRAINT — register BEFORE commit

`TAG_DECOY` is written only through `VaultRuntime.mutate`, which re-encodes the entire state under
one lock and schedules one atomic reseal. There is no multi-write sequence and therefore no partial
state to reason about: a crash leaves either the previous whole state or the new whole state.

The one ordering constraint, enforced in code and pinned by test:

> **The synthetic account must be registered on the relay BEFORE its credentials are committed to
> `VaultState`. A commit failure must leave an ORPHANED RELAY ACCOUNT (harmless — an unused
> registered account), never a `VaultState` referencing an account that does not exist (which breaks
> every subsequent decoy).**

This has a consequence that rules out the obvious implementation. `ApiClient.register()` writes the
new account id into its `AuthStore` the instant the 201 lands (`ApiClient.kt:167`), and
`createSession()` writes tokens the instant they are minted (`:186`). Wiring the synthetic client
straight to a vault-backed store would therefore commit `accountId` **alone**, with no identity
keypair — and an account id whose signing key was never persisted is exactly the dangling reference
above (worse than an orphan: it is unauthenticatable and permanent).

→ **Provisioning runs its `ApiClient` against a RAM-only `AuthStore`** (`StagingAuthStore`), so
`register` + `createSession` mutate nothing durable, and the credential set
`{accountId, identityKeyPair, accessToken, refreshToken}` is committed in **one** `runtime.mutate`
afterwards. Interruption points and their outcomes:

| Crash / failure point | Relay state | `VaultState` state | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| before `register` | nothing | unchanged (absent) | clean retry |
| `register` request sent, response lost | account may exist | unchanged (absent) | **orphan — accepted, harmless** |
| after 201, before `createSession` | account exists | unchanged (absent) | **orphan — accepted** |
| after tokens minted, before `mutate` | account exists | unchanged (absent) | **orphan — accepted** |
| `mutate` throws (capacity) | account exists | mutation retained in RAM, NOT scheduled; `capacityExceeded` set | orphan; the decoy credentials are lost on close. Never a dangling reference. |
| after `mutate` returns, before the reseal lands | account exists | previous whole state | orphan on the next open; retry re-provisions |
| after the reseal lands | account exists | credentials present | success |

**No row produces `accountId` without `identityKeyPair`.** That is the invariant the test matrix
pins (`crash-between-register-and-commit`).

Tokens are deliberately NOT flush-before-ack'd: like `VaultAuthStore`'s (`AuthStore.kt:145` kdoc),
they are recoverable by re-minting a session from the stored identity key, so a coalesced write is
correct.

## THE COUNTER INVARIANT — skip, never regress

`counterHighWater` means: **every counter value strictly below it may already have been issued.**

- Session start: RAM `next = limit = counterHighWater` (durable).
- `next()` when `next == limit`: `mutate { counterHighWater += 64 }` FIRST; only on a successful
  mutate do the RAM `next`/`limit` advance. Values in `[old, old+64)` are then issued from RAM.
- Crash at any point: the next session reads the persisted high-water and starts there. Unspent
  reserved values are **skipped**.

A skip is invisible — a real Double Ratchet skips counters on any dropped message. A REGRESSION is a
tell no real ratchet can produce, which is why the durable write precedes the first spend and why the
RAM advance is conditional on the mutate succeeding. One durable write per 64 decoys, per §2.3.

## WHAT THIS WRITE MUST NOT DO

1. **No device-level storage.** Vault-scoped or nowhere — including logs and `BootDiagnostics`.
   Enforced structurally: no decoy class takes a diagnostics/log sink.
2. **Must not make the sealed region's size vary with decoy state.** The region is fixed-size and
   stays so; the section rides inside the compressed, padded, sealed plaintext.
3. **Not a device-global singleton.** One instance per live `SessionContainer` (`NotificationScheduler`
   parity invariant 3). U1 ships the components unwired (see “Scope boundary”), constructed from a
   `VaultRuntime` — which is already per-session — so a global is structurally impossible.
4. **Must not survive teardown.** The provisioner is `suspend` and owns no timers; cancelling the
   session scope cancels it. U3/U5 add the `cancelAll()`-equivalent when they add timers.
5. **Must not name a slot, vault index, or real/decoy VAULT status** in code, logs, diagnostics, or
   string resources. (`TAG_DECOY` / `Decoy*` name the *cover-traffic mechanism*, which is the spec's
   own vocabulary — §4 W1–W4. The forbidden thing is labelling a VAULT as real vs decoy, or naming a
   slot index. U1 adds no string resource and no log line at all.)
6. **Must not push `VaultState` near `MAX_PAYLOAD_CONTENT_BYTES`.** U1 delivers a measured worst-case
   budget + a headroom test, since R5 depends on it.

## REGISTRATION IS A SCARCE SHARED GLOBAL RESOURCE

`registerLimit` is keyed on `c.IP()` (`handlers.go:166`), which behind Caddy is Caddy's socket
address — **one bucket worldwide** for clearnet and every Tor/I2P client. Therefore:

- **Lazy.** `provisionIfNeeded()` is called from the first session that actually needs a decoy — never
  eagerly at vault creation. A vault that never sends never spends a registration. (U1 ships the entry
  point; U3 supplies the caller.)
- **One attempt per session, ever.** An in-RAM latch means a failure is not retried within the
  session — no tight loop is even expressible.
- **429 backs off ACROSS sessions**, durably (W1b), for a randomized 60–90 min (the limiter window is
  1 h; the jitter avoids a synchronized retry stampede).
- **Every failure degrades SILENTLY to decoys-off.** No exception escapes `provisionIfNeeded()`, no
  UI is shown, no diagnostic is written, onboarding is never blocked. The caller gets
  `null` = "no synthetic account this session".

## CAPACITY BUDGET (to be measured, then recorded here)

Worst-case section contents: 36-char UUID + 65-byte `IdentityKeyPair.serialize()` + an RS256 access
JWT (~530 chars: 342-char base64 signature over a 2048-bit key, plus header/claims) + a 43-char
refresh token (`auth/jwt.go` `NewRefreshToken`: 32 random bytes, RawURL base64) + three fixed-width
integers. Uncompressed section ≈ 790 B. `DECOY_SECTION_BUDGET_BYTES = 1024` with the measured
deflated delta asserted under it. `MAX_PAYLOAD_CONTENT_BYTES = 262 112`, and a realistic full state
is ~8 KB (PR-D benchmark), so the headroom is ~3 orders of magnitude — the budget test exists to
catch a FUTURE field addition, not because this one is tight.

**MEASURED** (`VaultDecoySectionTest."the decoy section costs less than its declared budget…"`,
run 2026-07-27, twice): worst-case **encoded delta = 640–643 B** against a declared budget of
**1024 B**; a realistic populated state carrying the section encodes to **924–927 B of 262 112 B**,
leaving **~261 185 B (99.6 %) free**. The few-byte run-to-run spread is DEFLATE reacting to a
freshly generated (genuinely random) identity keypair, not fixture noise. The test asserts
`delta > 0` as well as `delta ≤ budget`, so a codec that silently dropped the section cannot
satisfy it.

## SCOPE BOUNDARY — what U1 deliberately does NOT do

The trigger for provisioning is "the first session that actually sends a decoy", and the decoy sender
is U2/U3. U1 therefore ships the codec section, the provisioner, the auth facade, and the counter
reservation **unwired from `SessionContainer`** — the same posture `VaultRuntime` itself shipped in
(`VaultRuntime.kt:69-70`: "deliberately NOT wired into any app coordinator, DI graph, unlock router,
or migration — that is a later sub-phase"). Nothing in production calls them yet, so U1 cannot
register a synthetic account on any real device and cannot spend a registration from the shared
bucket. U3 supplies the call site.

## SPEC CORRECTIONS — facts in `DECOY_TRAFFIC_0.10.0_SPEC.md` that are stale at `d44616c5`

1. **§6.1 “`regpow` is not in this tree — it lives on the unmerged `origin/cx23/0.9.4-registration-pow`
   branch.” — STALE for the CLIENT.** `apps/android/.../crypto/RegistrationPow.kt` is on `main` and
   is wired into `MessagingCoordinator.bootstrapLoop()` (`MessagingCoordinator.kt:465-486`), shipped
   in 0.9.4-beta at `D=5`. `ApiClient.registrationChallenge()`/`register(powProof=)` exist
   (`ApiClient.kt:133,147`). Still TRUE for the RELAY: `handlers.go` `Register` (154–208) has no PoW
   check on `main`. Consequence for U1: the synthetic registration must mirror the real path —
   fetch a challenge, treat 404 as "relay predates PoW, register proofless", otherwise solve — and
   the §6.2a "decide before U1" question is answered: **background solve, no progress UI, silent
   failure**, because the hard constraint "never block onboarding, never surface an error implying a
   fault" forecloses reusing the pitcher screen.
2. **§6.2 “main still reads `ratelimit.New(5, time.Hour, ...)` at `handlers.go:48`” — STALE.** `main`
   now reads `ratelimit.New(300, time.Hour, cfg.RateLimitEnabled)` at `handlers.go:54`; the interim
   widening is merged. The §6.2a budget arithmetic (300/h global bucket, 150→100 devices/h) is
   therefore correct as written; only the "not merged to main / a redeploy silently reverts it"
   warning no longer applies to the limiter. **The `c.IP()` keying is unchanged (`handlers.go:166`),
   so the bucket is still global — CX23 P2 remains open.**

## DEVIATIONS FROM THE SPEC, AND WHY

1. **`provisionNotBeforeMs` is a SIXTH thing in a section §4 describes as holding three.** The U1
   brief requires "on 429 back off **across sessions**". Across-sessions means durable, and the
   no-device-storage rule means vault-scoped, so the deferral has exactly one legal home: this
   section. Consequence, carried into R4 above: **section presence no longer implies readiness**, and
   every reader must key on the credential pair. Flagged rather than absorbed silently, because it is
   precisely the "moving what a durable signal MEANS" shape the round-12 pattern warns about.
2. **W1 does not write a first dead-air fire time**, though §4's W1 row says it does. The dead-air
   *schedule* is U5 and §3.2 re-framed it from wall-clock to in-session ("1–2 per equivalent
   unlocked-day"), which makes a durable wall-clock next-fire of questionable meaning — U5 must
   settle that. The field exists and round-trips; U1 writes `null`. Deciding the distribution here
   would be U1 designing U5's mechanism blind.
3. **W3 (counter reservation) is built in U1**, not U2 as §4's writer table says. This follows the U1
   task brief, which lists counter reservation in U1 scope. Only the reservation ALLOCATOR is built;
   the `DecoySender` that spends the values is still U2.
