You are an INDEPENDENT SECURITY REVIEWER for Zitrone, a zero-knowledge plausible-deniability messenger.
This is ROUND 3 of a blind multi-reviewer review. You are reviewing the ROUND-2 FIX DELTA. Several reviewers run independently on
this same commit; you are blind to all of them. Report only what YOU derive from source.

YOU HAVE A PRIVATE, WRITABLE CHECKOUT. Read anything you need — git, grep, whole files — and you MAY
build and run tests here. It is a disposable worktree; nothing you do affects anyone else. NOTHING is
inlined in this brief and nothing has been trimmed. If a verdict depends on source, go read it; do not
caveat a verdict as unverifiable.

SCOPE — the whole unit as it would merge:
  git diff main...HEAD          (a98677f extraction + 0d348b4 + 54a41bf)
  git show 54a41bf              (the fix delta under primary review)

## What this unit is, and why it exists as its own unit
Unit W-A is an EXTRACTION. A larger unit ("Unit W") combined a duress-wipe mechanism, its
post-wipe presentation layer, and this residue sweep. That unit ran six adversarial review rounds and
reached its cap WITHOUT clean convergence: each fix was locally correct and wrong one layer out, all of
the same family — *an authoritative result exists and a consumer uses something weaker*. The maintainer
judged the unit under-DESIGNED rather than under-reviewed and split it. This is the half that every
lens had independently cleared; the duress-wipe mechanism and its presentation layer are deferred to a
separate unit that is being redesigned.

**THEREFORE: the prior rounds reviewed this code IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT. You are reviewing the
EXTRACTION.** Extraction can introduce defects that no earlier round could have seen. Do not treat any
earlier conclusion as carrying over.

## What the unit does
The vault directory can legitimately hold a `vault.dek` / `vault.bin.tmp` / `vault.dek.tmp` with NO
`vault.bin`. Two ordinary interruptions produce it: an interrupted `create()` (DEK written durably
before the image) and an interrupted `retireLegacyImage()` (unlinks image, then DEK). Boot routing
keyed on `vault.bin` alone read that as "no vault" and presented first-run onboarding — while
`vault.bin.tmp` stages a COMPLETE outer image. The unit adds a cold-start sweep that deletes the
orphan, plus fail-closed boot routing that consumes the sweep's durability verdict.

DO NOT MODIFY the canonical repository. Building and testing inside your own worktree is expected.

VERIFY EVERY CLAIM AGAINST SOURCE. Do not trust comments, kdoc, or the commit message. In the parent
unit, comments were wrong repeatedly and each was caught only by re-derivation: an invariant table
internally coherent but wrong about ownership; a kdoc asserting a wait that did not happen; a kdoc
claiming `create()` "refuses" when it CLEARS; two test headers naming mutations they could not catch.

## What round 2 found, and what 54a41bf changed (VERIFY EACH FIX IS REAL, COMPLETE, AND SAFE)
Fixes are NOT lower-risk than original code. In this unit, three separate mechanical edits silently
REMOVED test coverage while leaving the file compiling and green (a deleted table-row test, a dropped
`@Test` annotation, a deleted `throw CancellationException` argument). Check that these fixes did not
do the same.
- MEDIUM (3 lenses): the session collector ran `isLegacyImage()` (~1 MiB read + Keystore unwrap + AEAD
  decrypt) on the MAIN dispatcher, on every lock/sign-out. Fixed STRUCTURALLY:
  `deriveBootDecisionFromDisk` is now `suspend` and moves itself to IO, so no caller chooses the
  dispatcher. Verify all three call sites and that nothing else calls the derivation off-IO.
- MEDIUM: `deriveBootDecision` had no coverage. New `DeriveBootDecisionTest`. Verify it tests the
  WRAPPER's behaviour (probe suppression, fail-closed probe) and not merely `bootRoute` again.
- MEDIUM: gate 2's tristate was uncovered — a mutation to `File.exists()` passed silently. Row 8 added
  (ELOOP on the confirmed marker, asserting the DEK survives). Verify it catches that mutation and
  that no OTHER tristate gate is still uncovered.
- LOW: the WRITER/READER table's intent-gate proof was FALSE (`retireLegacyImage()` runs before
  `create()` clears markers). Row 6c added. Verify the corrected proof, and hunt for any OTHER row
  whose justification claims unreachability that does not hold.
- LOW: `a retry after a cancelled run does not re-sweep` performed no cancellation. Now cancels.
- INFO: dead wrapper removed; `obliterationComplete` renamed `imageBearingProvenAbsent`; an orphaned
  doc line reattached.

## Binding focus items
A0. **SIBLING CALL SITES OF EVERY ROUND-1 FIX.** The single-derivation change (`deriveBootDecision`)
   touched all three consumers at once — verify each now passes the FULL input set and that none was
   left on an older shape. The removed legacy effect: confirm no OTHER path still routes on legacy
   without the confirmed-marker precedence. The restored row-7 test: confirm no OTHER gate is
   uncovered.
A. **NOTHING BURN-DEPENDENT SURVIVED THE CUT.** The duress-wipe mechanism (`burnVault`,
   `obliterateForBurn`, `wipeBiometricMaterial`, `wipeAppLocalStateForBurn`) and its presentation
   layer (`BurnCompletion`, `postBurnRoute`, `signalBurnCompleted`, `tryApplyBurnCompletion`) are all
   supposed to be absent. `onBurn` in MainActivity is claimed to be UNCHANGED FROM MAIN (a stub that
   shows a uniform failure and destroys nothing) — verify that against `git show main:` yourself.
B. **THE COUPLING LINE IS CLEANLY SEVERED.** In the parent unit the two halves were coupled by exactly
   one line, `signalBurnCompleted(obliterated = burned)` inside `onBurn`. Confirm no residue of that
   coupling remains — no dangling caller, no half-removed state, no field that now has no writer.
C. **THE TWO EXCLUDED HEALERS LEFT NO DANGLING CALLERS OR STALE REFERENCES.**
   `completeInterruptedBurn()` and `reconcileOrphanedBurnMarkers()` were deliberately excluded because
   their trigger states are unreachable by construction without the duress wipe. Verify that claim
   independently: `create()` writes the DEK first, and `destroy()` writes `vault.delete-confirmed`
   durably before it unlinks. Then confirm nothing references them and no comment still assumes they
   run.
D. **W-A IS CORRECT STANDALONE, INCLUDING THE "STRICTLY BETTER THAN MAIN" CLAIM.** The unit claims
   that today (on main) `{bin absent, dek present}` routes to onboarding and is overwritten by a later
   create, whereas W-A clears it durably first — i.e. no state is made worse. Verify or refute.
E. **THE SWEEP GATE.** It is a DESTRUCTIVE BOOT OPERATION running before any authentication. Prove
   BOTH directions: what it wrongly DELETES and what it wrongly STRANDS. Prove the WRITER/READER table
   COMPLETE, not self-consistent — hunt the MISSING ROW. There is deliberately no `delete-intent` gate;
   verify that reasoning against `destroy()` and `create()` rather than accepting it.
F. **THE VERDICT IS CARRIED, NOT RE-DERIVED.** The sweep's durability result must reach the routing
   decision as a value, never be recomputed there from a fresh stat (a stat reports absence the instant
   a file is unlinked, durable or not). Enumerate EVERY consumer of boot-routing state and confirm each
   uses the carried verdict, is ordered after publication, and passes the FULL input set to `bootRoute`.
   This exact class produced six HIGHs in the parent unit — in four different forms: verdict discarded
   and recomputed; consumer running before publication and reading a default; a second code path
   deciding the same thing; and the same function called with fewer arguments than another caller
   passes.
G. **`runBootReconcile`'s CONTRACT:** once-only, publication in `finally` on every exit including
   cancellation, fail-closed default, and a claim that cannot be stranded. Verify against source, then
   against its tests.
H. **INDEPENDENTLY RUN THE TEST SUITE.** Do not trust any reported figure. Run it in your worktree
   (`cd apps/android && ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`) and report the
   numbers YOU observed. The commit claims 483 total / 0 failures / 480 passed / 3 skipped.
I. **TEST QUALITY.** Does any test pass vacuously? Does any header claim a mutation it cannot catch?
   Is anything tested against a COPY of the logic rather than the logic itself? Name the failure shape
   that is still untested.

## Output
For each finding: SEVERITY (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/INFO), file:line, the defect, why it matters,
concrete fix. Cite source you actually read. Give explicit verdicts on A–I. State clearly whether this
is READY TO MERGE. An honest clean pass is a real and expected outcome if the code holds — do NOT
invent findings to appear thorough.
