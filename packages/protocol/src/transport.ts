// Multi-transport types (v1.5). The relay transport hierarchy is FIXED, not
// user-selectable: I2P is the primary anonymous transport, Tor is the relay
// fallback when I2P is unavailable, and clearnet is the last resort (always
// warned). I2P is a skeleton in v1.5 — the chain is in place so a future
// release can enable live I2P traffic without structural change; until then,
// the web transport resolver's detectI2P() (apps/web/src/lib/transportResolver.ts
// — this package only defines the shared types) always returns false and the
// chain falls through to Tor. See docs/TOR_ARCHITECTURE.md.
