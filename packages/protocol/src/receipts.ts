/**
 * Read receipts — encrypted control payloads carried INSIDE the plaintext of
 * an ordinary message envelope (`message.send`, media_type "text", no TTL, no
 * burn flag). On the wire a receipt is indistinguishable from conversation
 * text, which is the whole point: the relay never learns read status, not
 * even that a receipt exists. A dedicated frame type (the way `message.burn`
 * works) would leak exactly when messages are read; riding `message.send`
 * also gives receipts the same store-and-forward guarantee as messages, so a
 * sender who is offline when their message is read still receives the
 * receipt on reconnect.
 *
 * Clients recognize receipts AFTER decryption, by the discriminator below,
 * and must never render a recognized receipt as message text. The serialized
 * payload is padded like any message plaintext before encryption (256-byte
 * blocks — packages/crypto padding.ts and Android's MessagePadding), so
 * ciphertext length cannot fingerprint a receipt either. Burn-on-read
 * messages never produce a receipt — their propagated burn signal is the
 * read confirmation.
 *
 * Parsing is strict on the discriminator (`v` AND `control` must both match)
 * and lenient on extra fields, so future revisions can extend the payload
 * without old clients mistaking receipts for text.
