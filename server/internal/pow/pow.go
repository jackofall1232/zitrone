// Package pow verifies the hashcash proof-of-work a client must solve to deposit
// a dead drop. Deposit carries no authentication by design — anonymity of the
// sender depends on there being no account to present — so a CPU cost stands in
// for auth to keep anonymous deposit from being free to spam.

// A solution is an 8-byte nonce such that SHA-256(challenge || nonce) begins with
// `difficulty` zero bits. The challenge is the drop ID, binding the work to one
// specific deposit so it cannot be precomputed or replayed across drops.
