/**
 * Control payloads (currently: read receipts) ride INSIDE the encrypted
 * plaintext of an ordinary message envelope — media_type "text", no TTL, no
 * burn flag — deliberately indistinguishable from a real message on the wire.
 * That is what makes the Settings copy true: "Encrypted signal — the server
 * never knows read status". A dedicated plaintext frame type (the way
 * message.burn works) would tell the relay exactly when messages are read;
 * riding message.send instead also gives receipts the same store-and-forward
 * guarantee as messages, so a sender who is offline when their message is
 * read still gets the receipt on reconnect. The serialized payload is padded
 * like any message plaintext before encryption (see MessagePadding), so
 * ciphertext length cannot fingerprint a receipt either.
 *
 * Wire shape (canonical cross-client definition:
 * packages/protocol/src/receipts.ts):
 *
 *   {"v":1,"control":"receipt.read","message_ids":["<uuid>", ...]}
 *
 * Parsing is strict on the discriminator (both "v" and "control" must match)
 * and lenient on extra fields, so future revisions can extend the payload
 * without old clients mistaking receipts for conversation text. The corner
 * case of a user typing this exact JSON as a message is accepted: it would
 * arrive, parse as a receipt for ids that don't exist, and be dropped.
