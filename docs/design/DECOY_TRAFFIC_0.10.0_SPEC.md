# 0.10.0-beta — Decoy traffic: SPEC

**Status: ✅ APPROVED by maintainer 2026-07-27, with three rulings recorded below. U1 may begin.**
Architect: Fable. Implementation: Opus. Research lanes: Sonnet (3, complete).

### Maintainer rulings (2026-07-27)

1. **Doc corrections pulled out and shipped ahead of U1 — DONE.** Commit `96982421`. The published
   overclaims were corrected in place, visibly rather than silently, same handling as the burn
   relay-account correction. A full sweep for *every* instance found **four** claims, not the three
   flagged: sealed sender, typing indicators, decoy traffic, **and 3-hop onion relay** (design and
   code exist; no client routes messages through it). Website and onion site swept — clean.
   **Residual, tracked as U0 (code, not docs):** the same claims persist in client string constants
   — `packages/protocol/src/connection.ts:55`, `apps/android/.../ConnectionMode.kt:48`,
   `apps/ios/.../ConnectionMode.swift:80`, `apps/web/src/screens/Settings.tsx:152-165`. Only the web
   client renders any of them and it is undeployed, so nothing user-visible currently shows a false
   claim. U0 folds into U6's doc work or lands earlier at Opus's discretion.
2. **Format break: option (a) RATIFIED.** One-way format bump, disclosed exactly as 0.9.1's
   fresh-install-only decision was. (b) is rejected on the recorded grounds: it cannot rescue builds
   already in the field and pays for its safety by loosening a deliberately chosen invariant.
   **The storage-format-stability gate is answered in §4.1 — not deferred a third time.**
3. **Threat model ships in the docs in this spec's own words.** Partially landed already in
   `96982421` (the "Decoy traffic" section of `SECURITY_MODEL.md` now carries the
   passive-observer-yes / relay-operator-no framing and the mechanism-status-only indicator wording
   ahead of the feature). U6 completes it and must not weaken it.

**Approved as specified, no changes:** size mirroring rather than randomization, with the honest
consequence that block class still leaks; random ciphertext rather than a real ratchet, with the
reseal-rate reasoning intact; counter reservation at 64; the in-session dead-air reframe with
`VAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 **amended** rather than quietly diverging; 821 B single block for the
unpaired ping; the control-channel gap declared as a known residual.

Design is **not re-derived here**. It is locked in `docs/VAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 (lines 324–346)
and this spec builds on it verbatim. What this document adds is (1) resolution of the two open
questions §8 recorded, (2) the source-verified facts that constrain them, (3) the WRITER/READER
invariant table for the new durable signal, and (4) a unit breakdown.

---

## 0. Executive summary — what changed once the code was read

Three findings reshape the spec relative to what §8 could assume. None of them contradict the
locked design; two of them *strengthen* it, one narrows what it can honestly claim.

1. **The relay was already built for this.** `server/internal/db/schema.sql:34-40` deliberately has
   **no foreign key** on `envelopes.recipient_id`, with a comment naming decoy traffic as the
   reason. Send-to-anyone is accepted, stored, pushed, and acked identically. **No server change of
   any kind is required.** The blind-transport constraint is satisfied by construction, not by
   effort.

2. **The synthetic-pinned-account decision buys indistinguishability by instantiation.** The
   existing web decoy generator (`packages/relay-client/src/decoy.ts`) is statistically
   distinguishable *today* — it pins `message_number: 0`, `previous_chain_length: 0`,
   `ttl_seconds: null`, `burn_on_read: false` on every decoy, and addresses nowhere-UUIDs that are
   never acked, so each decoy sits in the relay's `envelopes` table for the full 72 h TTL while
   real messages are acked and deleted within seconds. A decoy addressed to a **real, registered,
   connected, acking** account has none of those tells. This is the strongest argument for the
   settled design and it is now evidence-backed.

3. **Decoy traffic does not hide anything from the relay, and cannot be claimed to.**
   `sender_id` and `recipient_id` ride the envelope in **cleartext**, and `ws/hub.go:166` rejects
   any envelope whose `sender_id` does not match the authenticated connection. "Sealed Sender"
   exists in the codebase (`packages/crypto/src/sealedbox.ts`) but is wired only to dead-drop and
   lemon-drop, never to ordinary messaging. The 3-hop onion path is likewise config-only — no
   client calls `buildCircuit` or `POST /relay/forward` for a message send.
   **Therefore: decoys defend against a passive network observer who sees only TLS frame sizes and
   timings. They do not defend against the relay operator.** The spec is written to that threat
   model and §7 requires `SECURITY_MODEL.md` to say so in those words.

---

## 1. Threat model — stated before the mechanism

| Adversary | What they see | Does decoy traffic help? |
|---|---|---|
| **Passive network observer** (ISP, Wi-Fi, hostile exit, traffic-analysis at scale) | TLS record sizes and timings only. Cannot read any envelope field. | **YES — this is the target.** A paired decoy makes "user sent a message" indistinguishable from "user sent nothing of consequence," and doubles the candidate set for any timing correlation against a peer's receive event. |
| **Hostile / compromised relay operator** | Cleartext `sender_id`, `recipient_id`, `timestamp`, `ttl_seconds`, `burn_on_read`, ratchet counters. Can trivially learn that account *S* only ever transacts with account *A*. | **NO, and the docs must not imply otherwise.** Closing this requires sealed sender or onion routing for ordinary sends — both unbuilt. Out of scope for 0.10.0. |
| **Forensic adversary with the device** | Whatever is durable. | **Neutral by requirement.** Every vault gets exactly one synthetic account; a locked vault's slot is indistinguishable from random. The mechanism must not become a vault-count oracle — see §4. |

**Existing doc overclaims found, which block an honest §7 and must be corrected as part of this
release** (they are pre-existing, not introduced here):
- `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md:1032` — "decoy traffic defeats the timing correlation," stated
  unconditionally and about a mechanism that does not exist on the shipped client.
- `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md:318` — claims typing indicators are encrypted signals. They are
  plaintext control frames carrying `peer_id` in the clear (`WsClient.kt:369-371`, `hub.go:145`).
- `docs/SECURITY_MODEL.md:379` — "Sealed Sender" listed for standard messaging; not implemented
  for that path.

---

## 2. OPEN QUESTION 1 — envelope size and structure indistinguishability. **RESOLVED.**

### 2.1 The measured baseline

Padding is real, correct, and byte-identical across platforms (`packages/crypto/src/padding.ts`,
`MessagePadding.kt` — `len(4,BE) ‖ plaintext ‖ random-fill`, rounded up to 256 B, applied
**before** encryption). Computed frame sizes:

| Content | Padded block | Full `message.send` frame |
|---|---|---|
| Short text or batched read receipt (≤252 B) | 256 | **821 B** |
| Text 253–508 B | 512 | **1161 B** |
| Attachment control payload (always 286 B) | 512 | **1161 B** |
| X3DH first message, short text | 256 | **860 B** (+39 B: `ephemeral_key`, `prekey_id` non-null) |

Padding does **not** by itself produce uniformity. Three residual size/structure tells exist
independently of decoys: block count is visible; the attachment control payload is 286 B so it
*always* lands one block bigger than a short text; and the X3DH first message is +39 B with two
fields flipping non-null.

### 2.2 Resolution — size mirroring, and structure by instantiation

**Structure: the decoy is not an imitation of a real envelope, it is a real envelope.**
It is addressed to a genuinely registered account, over a session that was genuinely established
with one X3DH first message at setup, with monotonically advancing counters. Every cleartext field
is populated the way the real send path populates it. There is no field whose value is a constant
that a real message's value varies over — which is precisely the defect in the existing web
generator.

**Size: the paired decoy mirrors the block count of the real message it is paired with, exactly.**

This is the whole resolution and it is worth stating plainly: do **not** randomize decoy size, and
do **not** always send a single block. Mirror. A real 1161 B attachment send emits a 1161 B decoy;
a real 821 B text emits an 821 B decoy. The observer then sees two identical-size frames a few
milliseconds apart in an order they cannot predict, and has no size-based way to say which was
real. Randomizing instead would create pairs like {821, 1161} where the attachment-shaped frame is
immediately identifiable as the real one whenever the user's actual message was short.

Consequence to accept honestly and document: mirroring **preserves** the block-count signal (an
observer still learns "an attachment-sized thing was sent"). It hides *which transmission was the
real one*, not *what class of thing was sent*. That is the correct scope for a paired scheme and it
must not be described as more.

### 2.3 The ciphertext does not need to be a real ratchet output — and should not be

The synthetic account is our own and the decoy is burned on delivery, so **nothing ever needs to
decrypt it.** Therefore the decoy ciphertext is `random(32) ‖ random(12) ‖ random(N·256 + 16)` —
byte-shaped identically to a genuine `ratchet_pub ‖ nonce ‖ AEAD(ct+tag)` blob and
computationally indistinguishable from one to anybody without the key, which includes everybody.

This is a deliberate rejection of "run a real Double Ratchet with the synthetic peer," for a
specific and load-bearing reason: **every real ratchet advance is a durable `VaultState` mutation,
so a real-ratchet decoy would double the vault reseal rate.** That is battery cost, capacity
pressure against `MAX_PAYLOAD_CONTENT_BYTES`, and — worst — new write traffic through the exact
`VaultSession` flush machinery that 0.9.1 spent eleven review rounds hardening. Random ciphertext
buys the same observable at none of that cost.

**What must still be durable is the counter**, because a `message_number` that resets or regresses
is a tell a real ratchet can never produce. Handled by **reservation**: reserve a block of 64
counter values, make the new high-water mark durable, then spend the block from RAM and reserve
again when it is exhausted. A crash therefore *skips* counter values (invisible — a real ratchet
skips too, on any dropped message) but can never *regress* them. One durable write per 64 decoys
instead of one per decoy.

> **CORRECTION (2026-07-27, U1 review round 1 — the architect's error, not the implementer's).**
> This paragraph originally read "reserve a block of 64 counter values **in `VaultState`** … persist
> a new reservation when exhausted", which specified the right invariant against the wrong
> mechanism. **Writing to `VaultState` is not persistence.** `VaultRuntime.mutate` applies the block
> to the live state, encodes it, and hands the bytes to `VaultSession.update`, which snapshots,
> marks the session dirty and returns — "Non-blocking by session contract: it copies + schedules, no
> I/O here" (`VaultRuntime.kt:132`). The write lands later, when the ≤2 s coalescing ceiling fires.
> A crash inside that window loses the high-water mark, and the next session reissues the whole
> block — precisely the regression this mechanism exists to prevent.
>
> **The durable step is `VaultRuntime.flushBeforeAck()` → `VaultSession.flushNow()`, and its throw
> means the value was never issued.** The rule generalizes past the counter, and every U1 writer was
> re-audited against it: **anything whose correctness depends on surviving process death must
> `mutate` AND `flushBeforeAck`, and must treat a throw from the flush as "it never happened".**
> That covers the counter reservation (the RAM cursor advances only after the flush returns), the
> credential commit (which reports readiness, and had spent a scarce global registration), and both
> back-offs (§6.2a's "back off across sessions" is a durability claim). It does NOT cover the
> session tokens, which stay coalesced because they are re-mintable from the stored identity key —
> the same exception `VaultAuthStore` makes.
>
> §4's R4 reader row and the U1 WRITER/READER table inherited the same error and are corrected in
> `l00prite/.l00prite/reviews/decoy-0.10.0/u1-invariant-table.md`. **U2–U6 inherit the corrected
> rule, not this paragraph's original wording.**

### 2.4 The uncovered channel — declared, not silently ignored

`typing.start/stop` (72 B), `message.ack` (74 B), `message.burn` (124 B), `message.received`
(128 B) are plaintext control frames carrying `peer_id`/`message_id` in the clear. They are
trivially separable from any `message.send` (821 B+) by size alone, and **this scheme generates no
cover for them.** A real conversation also produces inbound receipt traffic from the peer that a
decoy exchange does not naturally produce.

Partial mitigation is in scope (§5, U4): the synthetic side acks and burns, and occasionally sends
back, so a decoy exchange produces control frames of its own rather than being a conspicuously
one-directional flow. Full coverage of the control channel is **explicitly out of scope for
0.10.0** and must be listed as a known residual in `SECURITY_MODEL.md`. Per the standing rule about
silently-capped coverage: this gap is written down, not left to be discovered.

---

## 3. OPEN QUESTION 2 — idle-ping sizing. **RESOLVED, and the premise is corrected.**

### 3.1 The premise correction — this is the finding that most changes §8

**The app has no background execution of any kind.** Verified: `AndroidManifest.xml` declares no
service and no receiver; there are zero matches across the entire Android source for
`WorkManager`, `AlarmManager`, `JobScheduler`, `FirebaseMessaging`, or `startForeground`; the only
permissions are `INTERNET`, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, `USE_BIOMETRIC`, `CAMERA`. `VaultLockManager.kt:69`
states it as design: *"There is no push stack: messages only arrive over the live WebSocket while
the app is unlocked."* Network clients exist only inside a live `SessionContainer`, which exists
only between `unlock()` and `lock()`.

So a literal "1–2× per day, randomly timed, covering dead-air" daemon **cannot be built as
specified** without introducing background infrastructure this app has deliberately never had. And
it should not be: the synthetic account's credentials live inside the vault, so a locked-state ping
would require either holding vault-derived secrets outside the vault — a direct deniability
violation — or a background service that wakes and can produce no traffic, which is worse than
nothing.

### 3.2 Resolution — reframe as in-session dead-air cover, and say so

Ship it as **dead-air cover within an unlocked session**: an unpaired decoy fires when a live
session has been quiet for a randomized interval, targeting a rate of 1–2 per equivalent
unlocked-day rather than per wall-clock day. Everything else about it is unchanged from §8.

This delivers what §8 actually wanted it to deliver — "total silence is not a signal" — for every
period the app can transmit at all, and is honest about the rest. §8 already assigned it little
unlinkability burden, so narrowing it costs the design nothing. **`VAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 must
be amended to this** rather than shipping something that quietly differs from the recorded design.

If a true 24/7 idle ping is later wanted, it is a separate release with its own gate: it needs a
foreground service, a persistent notification, and a fresh deniability analysis of what runs while
locked. Recorded as a follow-up, not smuggled in here.

### 3.3 Sizing — match the mode, do not sample a distribution

The standalone ping has no paired real message to mirror, so §2.2's mechanism does not apply.
**Always emit a single 256-byte block (821 B frame).**

The reasoning is that we cannot sample the real distribution even if we wanted to: message content
is **RAM-only and never persisted** (`MessagingCoordinator.kt:2343`; `MessageRepository` has no
persistence layer), so there is no history to draw from, and a guessed distribution that is wrong
is itself a fingerprint. The 821 B single block is the modal real frame by a wide margin — every
short text and every batched read receipt is one. An observer seeing 821 B frames during a quiet
period sees exactly what "the user sent a short message" looks like. Matching the mode exactly beats
inventing a spread.

---

## 4. Durable state — WRITER/READER invariant table

Built **before** implementation, per the standing rule: any change to a durable multi-reader signal
gets its writers, its readers, and what each reader assumes the signal MEANS at the moment it reads
enumerated first. The durable signal here is **`VaultState` TLV section `TAG_DECOY = 0x06`**.

Source-verified against `apps/android/app/src/main/java/com/zitrone/app/crypto/vault/VaultState.kt`
(tags `0x01`–`0x05` at lines 158–162; strict-v1 unknown-tag rejection at line 285) and
`crypto/vault/VaultRuntime.kt` (single mutation gate, lines 119–144) at current `main`.

### The signal

A new optional TLV section in the per-vault sealed payload holding exactly three things: the
synthetic account's **account id + identity keypair + session tokens**, the **counter reservation
high-water mark**, and the **dead-air schedule seed/next-fire**. It lives inside the vault region
and nowhere else. Nothing about decoy traffic may be written to device-level storage
(`SettingsRepository`, `DeviceSettings`, any `SharedPreferences`) — a device-level record of how
many synthetic accounts exist is a vault-count oracle and destroys the deniability §3 of
`VAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md` establishes. The section is written by exactly one component and the
fixed-size sealed region does not grow, so its presence or absence is not observable from the
encrypted image.

### WRITERS

| # | Writer | When | What it writes into `TAG_DECOY` | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | `DecoyAccountProvisioner.provision()` | First unlocked session in which decoys are enabled and no synthetic account exists | Full section: account id, identity keypair, initial tokens, counter reservation = 64, first dead-air fire time | **this unit (U1)** |
| W2 | `DecoyAccountProvisioner.refreshTokens()` | Synthetic session token refresh (7-day refresh-token TTL, `auth/jwt.go:26`) | Tokens only; all other fields untouched | **this unit (U1)** |
| W3 | `DecoySender.reserveCounters()` | Counter reservation exhausted (once per 64 decoys) | High-water mark only, monotonically increasing | **this unit (U2)** |
| W4 | `DeadAirPinger.rearm()` | After each dead-air ping fires | Next-fire time only | **this unit (U5)** |
| W5 | `VaultRuntime.mutate` (existing) | Every write above, without exception | Re-encodes whole `VaultState` under `stateLock` and **SCHEDULES** a reseal — **it is not durable**, see §2.3's correction | existing |
| W6 | `VaultRuntime.flushBeforeAck` (existing) | W1, W3, and both back-off writes — every value that must survive process death | Forces the scheduled payload to disk synchronously. **A throw means the value was never issued / never recorded** | existing — **added 2026-07-27 (U1 R1)** |

### READERS, and what each assumes `TAG_DECOY` MEANS

| # | Reader | Assumes `TAG_DECOY` means | Still true after W1–W4? |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | `VaultStateCodec.decode` | "a section tag I recognize; an unrecognized tag is corruption" | **NO for old builds — see hazard below.** YES for builds carrying the tag. |
| R2 | `DecoySender.send()` | "a provisioned synthetic account exists and these counters have never been issued before" | YES **only with §2.3's correction** — the mark must be FLUSHED, not merely mutated, before any value in the block is spent |
| R3 | `DeadAirPinger` | "next-fire is in this vault's own timeline, not the device's" | YES — per-vault, torn down at lock |
| R4 | `SessionContainer` construction | ~~"absent section = decoys not yet provisioned; present = ready"~~ **CORRECTED (U1 R1):** "ready = the credential pair is present **and** `VaultRuntime.capacityExceeded` is clear" | **NO as originally written.** Two falsifiers: a 429 (or a capacity) back-off creates a section that is PRESENT and NOT ready, and an over-capacity `mutate` RETAINS a complete credential pair in the LIVE state that was never scheduled and that `flushBeforeAck` refuses. Absence is still the valid initial state; presence never means ready. |
| R5 | Capacity guard `VaultRuntime.capacityExceeded` | "encoded state fits `MAX_PAYLOAD_CONTENT_BYTES`" | **Requires sizing proof — see constraints** |

### THE HAZARD THIS TABLE EXISTS TO CATCH

**`VaultStateCodec` is strict-v1: an unknown tag throws, it is never skipped** (`VaultState.kt:285`,
comment "an unknown tag is corruption / a wrong version, never skipped"). So a vault written by a
0.10.0 build carrying `TAG_DECOY` and then opened by a 0.9.x build — downgrade, sideload of an
older APK, an A/B test rollback — **does not degrade gracefully. It reads as a corrupt vault.**
Depending on how the corrupt path is handled that is anything from a failed unlock to a wiped
image, on a build whose whole purpose is deniable storage.

This is the specific interaction the table exists to surface, and it is the single highest-risk item
in the release. It must be resolved before U1 writes a line of code. Options, for the maintainer to
rule on:
- **(a)** Accept and gate: 0.10.0 is a one-way format bump, disclosed in release notes exactly as
  the 0.9.1 fresh-install-only decision was disclosed. Cheapest, consistent with the standing
  storage-format-stability gate still being open.
- **(b)** Make the decoder forward-tolerant for *unknown high tags only* first, as a separate
  prerequisite unit, shipped one release ahead so a downgrade target exists. Correct, but it
  weakens a strictness property that was chosen deliberately, and it cannot help downgrades to any
  build already in the field.
- **(a)** is the recommendation, because (b) does not actually rescue existing installs and buys
  its safety by loosening a deliberate invariant.

**RULING: option (a).** One-way format bump, disclosed as 0.9.1's fresh-install-only decision was.

### 4.1 Storage-format-stability gate — ANSWERED, not deferred a third time

The standing gate (`[[zitrone-storage-format-stability-gate]]`) says: before external testers,
either commit to storage-format stability or disclose wipe-on-breaking-change. It has now been
deferred twice, and 0.10.0 is the second breaking change. **Answering it is in scope for this
release.**

**The answer is DISCLOSE, and it cannot honestly be anything else right now.** Committing to
stability means promising that a future release will not require a wipe. Migrations are not built,
no migration framework exists, and 0.10.0 is itself proof that the format is still moving. A
stability promise made today would be a promise the project has no mechanism to keep — which is the
precise failure mode the deliver-then-claim rule exists to prevent.

So, shipping **with** 0.10.0, in release notes and in `SECURITY_MODEL.md`:

> **Your vault format is not yet stable.** Zitrone is in beta and the on-disk vault format is still
> changing. A future release may require a fresh install, which **erases every vault on the device
> and everything in them** — contacts, sessions, settings. There is no migration and no export. This
> release, 0.10.0-beta, is one such change: **vaults created by 0.10.0 cannot be opened by 0.9.x,
> and downgrading will present them as corrupt.** Do not keep anything in Zitrone that you cannot
> afford to lose.

**And the condition under which the promise flips**, so this is a commitment and not an indefinite
disclaimer: **stability is committed to when a migration path exists and has been exercised across
at least one real format change.** Until that lands, every release carrying a format change repeats
the disclosure. The gate is answered — the answer is "disclose, and here is what would change it" —
and it should now be closed in `todos.md` rather than carried forward a fourth time.

**Sequencing note:** the disclosure is a *precondition* for external testers, not for this release's
merge. But 0.10.0 must not ship without it, because 0.10.0 is the release that makes the second
break real.

### CRASH ATOMICITY — to be verified, not assumed

`TAG_DECOY` is written only through `VaultRuntime.mutate`, which re-encodes the entire state under
one lock and schedules one atomic reseal. There is no multi-write sequence and therefore no partial
state to reason about: a crash either leaves the previous whole state or the new whole state.
**(U1 R1: atomic ≠ durable. `mutate` guarantees that whatever lands is whole; it does not guarantee
that anything lands. See §2.3's correction for which writes must additionally flush.)** The
one ordering constraint that must be enforced in code and pinned by test: **the synthetic account
must be registered on the relay *before* its credentials are committed to `VaultState`, and a
commit failure must leave an orphaned relay account rather than a `VaultState` referencing an
account that does not exist.** An orphan is harmless (an unused registered account); a dangling
reference breaks every subsequent decoy send. U1's test matrix must cover crash-between-register-
and-commit explicitly.

### WHAT THIS WRITE MUST NOT DO

1. Must not write anything decoy-related to device-level storage. Vault-scoped or nowhere.
2. Must not make the sealed region's size vary with decoy state — the region is fixed-size and
   stays so.
3. Must not be a device-global singleton. One instance per live `SessionContainer`, per
   `NotificationScheduler` parity invariant 3.
4. Must not survive teardown. Every decoy component gets a `cancelAll()`-equivalent hook wired into
   `MessagingCoordinator.stop()` alongside the existing notification teardown.
5. Must not name a slot, vault index, or "real/decoy" anything in code, logs, diagnostics, or
   string resources — the slot-agnostic discipline of `crypto/vault/*` applies unchanged.
6. Must not push `VaultState` near `MAX_PAYLOAD_CONTENT_BYTES`. U1 delivers a measured byte budget
   for the section and a test asserting headroom, since R5 depends on it.

---

## 5. Implementation units — Rule of 6, hard cap at 6

Each unit is independently reviewable, adversarially reviewed to convergence, and merged before the
next begins. No version bump, no push, nothing merged without explicit maintainer approval.

| Unit | Scope | Gate to clear before the next unit |
|---|---|---|
| **U1** | Synthetic account provisioning + `TAG_DECOY` codec section. Lazy registration, credential storage, token refresh, capacity budget. | Format-break decision (§4 hazard) ruled on by maintainer **before code**. Crash-between-register-and-commit test matrix green. Provisioning is lazy, backs off across sessions on 429, and degrades silently to decoys-off on failure (§6.2a). |
| **U2** | Decoy envelope builder + counter reservation. Random-ciphertext blob at a requested block count; field population mirroring the real send path. | Byte-level test asserting a decoy frame is indistinguishable field-for-field from a real frame of the same block count, *including* that no field is a constant where a real message varies. |
| **U3** | Pairing at the send choke point. Random order (decoy-first / real-first), few-ms stagger, block-count mirroring. Insertion inside `MessagingCoordinator`'s confined worker, above `ws.sendMessage`. | Ordering is uniformly random and stagger is drawn per-send — pinned by a statistical test, not by inspection. Real-send latency and the `flushSendRatchet` durability barrier provably unaffected. |
| **U4** | Synthetic-side receive: second WS connection for the synthetic account, deliver → ack → burn at ~30 ms, occasional send-back so the exchange is bidirectional. | Decoys never surface in UI, notifications, or unread counts. Notification parity §7 re-verified with decoys active. |
| **U5** | Dead-air ping within a session (§3.2), single block, per-vault schedule. | Fires only in a live session; torn down at lock with everything else. |
| **U6** | 🍋‍🟩 indicator + docs. `SECURITY_MODEL.md` honest framing, `VAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 amendment, the §1 overclaim corrections. | Ships **with** the feature, per deliver-then-claim. Not after. |

**Third lens blind at the cap.** If any unit reaches the review cap without convergence, a third
reviewer is dispatched blind per `[[zitrone-review-cli-invocation]]`, and work stops for maintainer
adjudication regardless of that reviewer's verdict.

### The indicator (U6) — exact framing

The 🍋‍🟩 indicator fires when the paired decoy for the most recent real send was successfully handed
to `WsClient`. That is *all* it asserts. Required wording, in-app and in `SECURITY_MODEL.md`:

> This shows that cover traffic was generated for your last message. It is a **mechanism-status
> indicator, not proof of unlinkability** — it tells you the feature ran, not that an adversary was
> defeated. Cover traffic protects against an observer watching your network connection. It does
> **not** hide your conversation partner from the relay operator, who sees sender and recipient on
> every message. If you need to verify the mechanism itself, read the send-pairing code.

The two-audience split is deliberate and is documented as such: average users get honest
reassurance that a feature is working; security-conscious users are pointed at the source. It is not
a dummy light, and the copy earns that by naming what it does not cover.

---

## 6. Dependencies and interactions the maintainer must rule on

1. **Registration PoW × synthetic accounts.** `regpow` is **not in this tree** — it lives on the
   unmerged `origin/cx23/0.9.4-registration-pow` branch; `Register` (`handlers.go:159-203`) has no
   PoW check today. Once it lands at D=5 (~2.8 s on a floor device), **provisioning a synthetic
   account costs a second PoW solve per vault.** U1 must either reuse the existing solver with its
   progress UI or provision in the background with a defined failure path. Decide before U1.
2. **The register limiter — registration volume is a SHARED GLOBAL RESOURCE, not per-client
   headroom.** `registerLimit` was widened 5/hour → **300/hour** on 2026-07-26 in `20ade12b`
   (maintainer-verified rebuilt, redeployed, and live on CX23; not independently verifiable from
   CX33, which has no SSH to the box). **300 is an interim number, not a fix.** The key is still
   `c.IP()`, which is still Caddy's socket address, so it is still **one global bucket shared by
   every client worldwide** — clearnet behind Caddy and every Tor/I2P client via the sidecars.

   The commit message also closes the question CX23 P2 was gated on: Caddy's `reverse_proxy` has
   **no `header_up` override, so it appends rather than overwrites `X-Forwarded-For`.** Trusting
   that header would let clients spoof their own bucket — strictly worse than the collapse.
   **`ProxyHeader` is therefore confirmed unsafe as-is**, and the real fix (non-IP keying) remains
   open as CX23 P2.

   **Two corrections owed outside this spec, found while verifying the above:**
   - `20ade12b` lives **only** on `origin/cx23/urgent-8443-and-ratelimit-interim` and is **not
     merged to main** — main still reads `ratelimit.New(5, time.Hour, ...)` at `handlers.go:48`.
     A relay redeploy built from main silently reverts both the widening **and** the 8443
     exposure fix. This should be merged or explicitly pinned before anything else touches the
     relay.
   - `l00prite/.l00prite/todos.md:592` still records P2 as unchecked at 5/hour. The ledger is
     stale relative to the deployed box and should be reconciled.

   **Why this constrains 0.10.0.** Because the bucket is global, decoy provisioning does not spend
   a client's own headroom — it spends everyone's. Budget in §6.2a.
2a. **Registration budget — explicit arithmetic.**

   **Per-device cost.** Onboarding today is **2 registrations**. Decoy traffic adds **one synthetic
   account per vault that has decoys active**, provisioned when that vault first runs a decoy
   session:

   | Configuration | Registrations | On-device PoW cost at D=5 |
   |---|---|---|
   | Today, any config | 2 | ~5.6 s expected |
   | Single vault + decoys | **3** | ~8.4 s expected, ~24 s at the 5% tail |
   | Two vaults, decoys in both | **4** | ~11.2 s expected, spread across two unlock sessions |

   Solve time is geometrically distributed — ~37% of solves exceed the expectation and ~5% exceed
   3× — so the tail figures are the ones the UX must tolerate, not the mean. The synthetic
   provisioning solve must not be presented as a second onboarding wait; U1 decides between reusing
   the existing solver's progress UI or provisioning in the background with a defined failure path.

   **Global cost — the number that actually matters.** At a shared 300/hour bucket, adding one
   registration per onboarding drops worldwide onboarding capacity from **150 devices/hour to 100
   devices/hour, a 33% reduction**, before counting second vaults. Decoy provisioning must therefore
   be treated as spending a scarce shared resource:
   - **Provision lazily**, on the first session that actually sends a decoy — never eagerly at vault
     creation. A vault that never sends never spends a registration.
   - **Back off and retry across sessions on 429**, never in a tight loop. A 429 is contention with
     other users worldwide, not a client fault. **(U1 R1: "across sessions" is a durability claim —
     the deferral must be FLUSHED, not merely mutated, or a crash inside the coalescing window loses
     it and the next unlock walks straight back into the bucket. See §2.3's correction.)**
   - **Back off the same way when the vault cannot STORE the account [U1 R1].** A vault at its
     capacity boundary registers successfully and then fails to commit; with no durable back-off
     that is one new relay account per unlock, forever, against this same global bucket —
     systematic and unbounded rather than the accepted one-off orphan. The failed commit must also
     be reverted so a cover-traffic write never leaves the vault unable to flush-before-ack a real
     inbound message.
   - **A failed or deferred provision must degrade silently to "decoys off"** — never block
     onboarding, never surface an error that implies a fault, and never let the 🍋‍🟩 indicator claim
     the mechanism fired when it did not.

   **Sequencing recommendation:** the interim 300 absorbs 0.10.0's added load at current beta
   volumes, so this does not block the spec. But non-IP registration keying (CX23 P2) should land
   before any announcement that grows onboarding volume, since decoys make the shared bucket
   saturate 33% sooner.

3. **Send rate limit.** `sendLimit` is 100/min per account (`main.go:51`, `hub.go:159`). Pairing
   doubles outbound volume; a human sender will not approach it. Noted, no action.
4. **Two concurrent WS connections from one device.** Permitted — the one-connection-per-account
   rule (`hub.go:55-63`) is per account id. The correlation cost is real and is covered by the §1
   threat model: the relay can already identify the synthetic account regardless.
5. **Web `DecoyScheduler` reconciliation.** `packages/relay-client/src/decoy.ts` implements the
   standing-Poisson-cadence model that §8 deliberately rejected, wired only in the undeployed web
   client. Recommendation: leave the code, add a doc note that it is not the 0.10.0 design and is
   known-distinguishable. Do not extend it.
6. **`ConnectionMode.kt` dead fields.** `decoyTraffic`, `decoyIntensity`, `cadenceSeconds()` exist
   on Android with **zero consumers**. The paired design has no intensity knob. Recommendation:
   reduce to a single on/off in U3 and delete the cadence machinery rather than wire a concept the
   design rejected.
7. **Storage-format stability gate** — see §4. Must be answered, not deferred.

---

## 7. Out of scope for 0.10.0 — stated so it is not mistaken for coverage

- Cover for the plaintext control-frame channel (typing, ack, burn, received). §2.4.
- Any defense against a hostile relay. Requires sealed sender or onion routing for ordinary sends;
  both are unbuilt config-only today. §1.
- A true 24/7 background idle ping. Requires background infrastructure the app has never had. §3.2.
- iOS, desktop, web. Android only, per-active-vault.

## 8. Still open from 0.9.4, tracked, not blocking

- Onion mirror serves a stale APK while the website advertises v0.9.4's checksum; needs CX23
  access. Must clear before the project is announced.
- 0.9.4 shipped without its independent branch review — a deliberate recorded call; the review is
  still owed.
